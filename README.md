=================

Converts Maven Artifacts to Eclipse P2 Repository

Uses the [p2-maven-plugin](https://github.com/reficio/p2-maven-plugin "P2 Maven Plugin") to create OSGI bundles from Maven artifacts.
 
The generated artifacts are available at the Artifactory instance provided by JFrog for us: https://fuinorg.jfrog.io/fuinorg/eclipse-p2/
